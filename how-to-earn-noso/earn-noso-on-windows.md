# ðŸ’° Earn Noso on Windows

{% hint style="warning" %}
<mark style="color:red;">To earn Noso, you need a wallet and "Noso Earn" software.</mark>
{% endhint %}

1. **Step 1:**\
   Download the and install latest version of Nosolite wallet for your OS from Github.com [(here)](https://github.com/Noso-Project/NosoLite/releases)\
   Upon installation, Nosolite will generate a default address to use for earning and holding Noso coins.
2. \
   **Step 2:**\
   Download and install the latest Noso Earning software from Github.com [(here)](https://github.com/Noso-Project/consominer2/releases).
3. You may be required to create an exception rule in your antivirus software to run the application.
4. \
   **Step 3:**
5. 1 - Launch the Noso Earning app to autocreate files needed for configuration.
6. 2 - Modify the consominer2.cfg configuration file, updating the following fields:
7. `address AddressFromYourNosoLiteWallet`
8. `cpu 1` (setting this to more than 1 CPU is wasteful and doesn't increase your coins earned)
9. `test False` (set this to "False" so that Earning starts as soon as the app opens)
10. `custom seed`(change "mypasswrd" to a secure password which is 8-16 Base58 chars length)

**Step 4:**\
With configurations in place, you are now ready to start earning coins.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note, a typical earning period consists of **48 blocks** from the moment you start participating. It takes 7 1/2 hours to go through 48 blocks and you will not see coins in your wallet until after the 7 1/2 hours has lapsed. When participating, you will see a "balance" column with coins pending in green. This is the balance of coins you will receive when your participation period has expired.
