## **Minimum recommended requirements for running a node:**

* System running Windows or Linux OS
* 64bit based hardware.
* 2 CPUs
* 1024 MB Memory
* SSD based Hard-drive with 1GB of available space
* 100 Mbit/s internet connection
* Publicly accessible IP address (DHCP or Static) with TCP Port forwarding to Noso Node listening port.

The current Masternode stake requirement can be approximated with the following formula: (blockheight / 10) + 21\
Example: With a block height of 90000 and the formula ((90000 / 10) + 21) = 9021. Approximately 9021 coins

The MasterNode stake requirement will cap at 10,500 coins
