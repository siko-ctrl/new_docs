# üôè Project Funds

Project Funds were introduced at block 88406 as a method to compensate those who help to make the project better in the following categories.

1. Project coding / protocol
2. Project documentation&#x20;
3. Project promotion
4. Other impactful contributions to the project not mentioned

The way that project funds works is, 10% of each minted block reward is forwarded to the special Project funds address(<mark style="color:yellow;">NpryectdevepmentfundsGE</mark>).  This special address contains no keys and is only accessed by governance directive. This means a majority vote must be held to release funds for each project contribution.
